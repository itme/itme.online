# Understory Garden

Understory is a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden), a micro-publishing space for you to plant the seeds
of your ideas and grow them into bi-directionally linked web portals. It's a social
[zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) that lets users use [Web
Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) to get paid when people
spend time with their content.

If you think this sounds neat, check out our hosted instance at [understory.garden](https://understory.garden)
